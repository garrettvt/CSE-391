# CSE-391 UW Summer 2022
These are some of the homeworks that were done for CSE 391 in the summer of 2022. The class is titled "System and Software Tools" 
which gave an introduction to using Linux/Bash and command-line interface. Some things that we studied and practiced were I/O redirection,
streams, git, grep, regular expressions, permission, and basic shell scripting. The course website can be found below.
